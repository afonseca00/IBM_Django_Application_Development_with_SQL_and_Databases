# IBM_Django_Application_Development_with_SQL_and_Databases
This course provided me with hands-on experience in developing and implementing a Django web application with integrated SQL databases. I learned how to model data, compose SQL queries, use Django's ORM and implement Bootstrap in Django models. It taught me the skills to create and deploy database-driven applications in the cloud.
